## 

## Introduction: Per Scholas Module 3 Project - Game Browser

### [App Homepage Image](src/images/app-screenshot.png)

### The purpose of this project was to create a full CRUD app built with the following specifications:

- A working full-stack application, built by you, using the MERN stack: Node.js, MongoDB/Mongoose, Express and React.
- has one model for the user with full CRUD (create, read, update, and delete routes).
- Uses a passport auth system
- Pulls from a third party API
- Is deployed on Render
- Uses React-Router-Dom

## Technologies used:

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- Express
- Node
- React
- RAWG Video Game DB API

## Getting Started:

### [Render Link](https://orions-game-browser.onrender.com)

### To clone:

- git clone <https://github.com/Orion-Cole/MOD3-Project.git>
- npm install
- make new repo
- git remote set-url origin <\new url>

## Unsolved Problems:

- Loader Animation loops continuously if not enough data is returned from api to fill the game list
- Due to how the API works adding more tags broadens the search rather than shrink it making the tags less useful when used together

## Future Enhancements:

- Add way to change users name and email
- Utilize additional api to notify user if game on wishlist is on sale
- Add more tags and filter options
